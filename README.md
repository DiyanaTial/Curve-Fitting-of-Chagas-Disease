# Curve Fitting of Chagas Disease

This repository contains our **MATLAB project on curve fitting for Chagas Disease data analysis**.  
The goal is to model disease progression using different mathematical functions and evaluate how well they capture the underlying patterns in the dataset.

## Project Overview
- **Objective**: Fit mathematical models to real-world Chagas Disease data.  
- **Techniques Used**:  
  - Nonlinear curve fitting  
  - MATLAB’s `fit` and `fittype` functions  
  - Model evaluation with residual analysis and error metrics  

## Repository Structure
- `*.m` → MATLAB scripts for data processing, curve fitting, and plotting  
- `data/` → Input datasets (if applicable)  
- `results/` → Figures, fitted curves, and model comparisons  

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DiyanaTial/Curve-Fitting-of-Chagas-Disease.git
   cd Curve-Fitting-of-Chagas-Disease
   ```
2. Open MATLAB and run the main script:
   ```matlab
   run('Code.m')
   ```
   
## Results
- Comparison of different curve fitting models
- Visualizations of fitted curves against observed Chagas data
- Residual plots to evaluate model accuracy

## Requirements
- MATLAB R2023a or later

## Collaborators
- Diyana Tial
- Annalisa Berg
